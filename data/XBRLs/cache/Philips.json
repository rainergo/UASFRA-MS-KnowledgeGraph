In 2022, Sales to third parties and Net income\n                        for these subsidiaries in aggregate are EUR 472 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 522 million)\n                        and EUR 28 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 39 million), respectively.\n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n                        Investments in associates\n                        \n                            Philips has investments in a number of associates. During 2022, Philips purchased eight\n                            investments in associates for a total amount of \n                        EUR 256 million. The most\n                            notable investment was a EUR 172 million investment in B-SOFT Co, Ltd, a\n                            China-based IT supplier for the medical and health sectors, listed on the stock exchange in\n                            Shenzhen. Philips acquired only a 10% interest, but determined that it is able\n                            to exercise significant influence amongst others due to its representation on B-SOFT\u2019s Board\n                            of Directors.\u00a0None of these investments are regarded as individually material\n                            from the point of view of the consolidated financial statements.\u00a0\n                            In 2022, Philips recorded an impairment of \n                        EUR 66 million in relation to its\n                            interest in Candid Care Co. As part of the acquisition of Affera, Inc. by Medtronic plc in\n                            August 2022, the company sold its investment in Affera to Medtronic and recorded a gain of\n                            EUR 84 million on the sale.\u00a0\n                            Cumulative translation adjustments related to investments in associates were EUR 22 million\n                            as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 32 million).\n                    Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities\n                \n                    Philips founded three Philips Medical Capital (PMC) entities, in the United States, France and\n                    Germany, in which Philips holds a minority interest. Philips Medical Capital, LLC in the United\n                    States is the most significant entity. PMC entities provide healthcare equipment financing and\n                    leasing services to Philips customers for diagnostic imaging equipment, patient monitoring\n                    equipment, and clinical IT systems.\n                \n                    The company concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate the PMC\n                    entities. In the United States, PMC operates as a subsidiary of De Lage Landen Financial Services,\n                    Inc. The same structure and treatment is applied to the PMC entities in the other countries, with\n                    other majority shareholders. Operating agreements are in place for all PMC entities, whereby\n                    acceptance of sales and financing transactions resides with the respective majority shareholder.\n                    After acceptance of a transaction by PMC, Philips transfers control and does not retain any\n                    obligations towards PMC or its customers, from the sales contracts.\n                \n                    As of December 31, 2022, Philips\u2019 shareholding in Philips Medical Capital, LLC had a carrying value\n                    of \n                EUR 29 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 27 million).\n                    The company does not have any material exposures to losses from interests in unconsolidated\n                    structured entities other than the invested amounts.",

Fair value gains of EUR 95 million\n                                        are from investments in limited-life funds (mainly Gilde Healthcare) and other\n                                        investments recognized at fair value through profit or loss. Net interest\n                                        expense in 2021 was EUR 19 million lower than in 2020, mainly due\n                                        to lower interest expense on borrowings and provisions, and interest expense on\n                                        pensions. The increase in other financial income is mainly due to higher\n                                        interest income on tax.",

\n                        On June 14, 2021, Philips\u2019 subsidiary, Philips Respironics initiated a voluntary recall\n                        notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for certain\n                        sleep and respiratory care products related to the polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound\n                        abatement foam in these devices.\n                    \n                        The repair and replacement program is under way globally. Because of the prioritization of the\n                        repair and replace program, Philips is currently not taking new orders for sleep therapy\n                        systems, while masks and other consumables continue to be sold.\u00a0As of December 31, 2022,\n                        approximately \n                    90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement\n                        devices to patients has been completed. The time to complete the program is impacted by the\n                        dependency on supply of materials, including from China, and global logistics capacity.\u00a0Philips\n                        Respironics is also conducting a test and research program with independent laboratories.\u00a0\n                        Philips has recognized a provision based on Philips' best estimate of the costs to repair or\n                        replace devices subject to the Respironics field action. The provision is related to the cost to\n                        repair and/or replace affected devices and includes, amongst others, the costs for the remaining\n                        production, the cost of intensified communication with physicians and patients, material costs,\n                        labor cost and logistics. The provision does not include any product liability costs or other\n                        claims.

In 2022, following Philips Respironics\u2019\n                        comprehensive patient and customer communication outreach and based on current insights, the\n                        total expected units to be remediated have increased by approximately 0.4 million,\n                        primarily in the US. Furthermore, efforts to accelerate the program resulted in a shift towards\n                        replacement, which increased the replacement share to 60% (compared to\n                        46% as of December 31, 2021) and as a result further reduced repair quantities.\n                        Utilizations for the year reflect the costs incurred in executing the repair and replace program\n                        during the year.\n                        The completion of the field action continues to be subject to significant uncertainties, which\n                        require management to make estimates and assumptions about items such as quantities and the\n                        portion to be replaced or repaired.

\n                        On June 14, 2021, Philips\u2019 subsidiary, Philips Respironics initiated a voluntary recall\n                        notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for certain\n                        sleep and respiratory care products related to the polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound\n                        abatement foam in these devices.\n                    \n                        The repair and replacement program is under way globally. Because of the prioritization of the\n                        repair and replace program, Philips is currently not taking new orders for sleep therapy\n                        systems, while masks and other consumables continue to be sold.\u00a0As of December 31, 2022,\n                        approximately \n                    90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement\n                        devices to patients has been completed. The time to complete the program is impacted by the\n                        dependency on supply of materials, including from China, and global logistics capacity.\u00a0Philips\n                        Respironics is also conducting a test and research program with independent laboratories.\u00a0\n                        Philips has recognized a provision based on Philips' best estimate of the costs to repair or\n                        replace devices subject to the Respironics field action. The provision is related to the cost to\n                        repair and/or replace affected devices and includes, amongst others, the costs for the remaining\n                        production, the cost of intensified communication with physicians and patients, material costs,\n                        labor cost and logistics. The provision does not include any product liability costs or other\n                        claims.

In 2022, following Philips Respironics\u2019\n                        comprehensive patient and customer communication outreach and based on current insights, the\n                        total expected units to be remediated have increased by approximately 0.4 million,\n                        primarily in the US. Furthermore, efforts to accelerate the program resulted in a shift towards\n                        replacement, which increased the replacement share to 60% (compared to\n                        46% as of December 31, 2021) and as a result further reduced repair quantities.\n                        Utilizations for the year reflect the costs incurred in executing the repair and replace program\n                        during the year.\n                        The completion of the field action continues to be subject to significant uncertainties, which\n                        require management to make estimates and assumptions about items such as quantities and the\n                        portion to be replaced or repaired.

Given the early stages of the investigation, the company is not able to\n                            reliably estimate the financial impact, if any.\n                            Product liability claims\n                        \n                            Following the voluntary recall notification, a number of civil complaints have been filed in\n                            several jurisdictions against Philips Respironics and certain of its affiliates (including\n                            the company) generally alleging economic loss, personal injury and/or the potential for\n                            personal injury allegedly caused by devices subject to the recall.\n                        \n                            In the United States, consumer and commercial class action lawsuits have been filed alleging\n                            economic loss and medical monitoring claims. Individual personal injury lawsuits have also\n                            been filed. On October 8, 2021, a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the US District Court\n                            for the Western District of Pennsylvania was formed, and most of these class action and\n                            personal injury lawsuits have been consolidated in the MDL for pre-trial proceedings. As of\n                            December 31, 2022, plaintiffs have filed a consolidated economic loss class action complaint\n                            on behalf of device users, hospitals, and insurers and other third-party payers, a\n                            consolidated medical monitoring class action complaint on behalf of device users, and over\n                            \n                        300 individual personal injury complaints.\u00a0The company anticipates that the\n                            number of individual personal injury complaints will increase in 2023.\n                            In September 2022, the MDL court established a voluntary, court-approved census registry,\n                            and associated tolling, for potential claimants who have not filed claims, but may file\n                            claims in the future, relating to the Recalled Devices. The census registry replaces the\n                            private tolling agreement that had been in effect before the establishment of the census\n                            registry. At the time of termination, approximately \n                        60,000 individuals had\n                            entered into the private tolling agreement. In the event these individuals wish to pursue or\n                            preserve their claims, they will need to file a lawsuit or register on the census registry.\n                            By December 31, 2022, approximately 13,500 individuals had joined the census\n                            registry. The company anticipates that the number of individuals on the census registry will\n                            increase in 2023.\n                            In Australia, a consumer class action lawsuit alleging personal injury was filed against the\n                            company\u2019s subsidiary Philips Electronics Australia Ltd on October 4, 2021. In the course of\n                            2022, the plaintiff in the case has sought leave of the court to discontinue the class\n                            action citing that there is insufficient evidence to warrant the continuation of the class\n                            action and that since the issue of proceedings, Philips Respironics has been repairing,\n                            replacing, or refunding the devices which are the subject of the recall, meaning that any\n                            compensation relating to financial loss would be relatively confined. It is expected that\n                            the case will be discontinued in the first half of 2023.\n                        \n                            Philips Respironics and certain of its affiliates (including the company) are also\n                            defendants in consumer class action lawsuits in Canada and Israel and collective actions in\n                            Chile, France and the Netherlands alleging economic loss and/or personal injury.\n                        \n                            While the company believes it is probable that these lawsuits will in the aggregate lead to\n                            an outflow of economic resources for Philips Respironics or other Philips entities, given\n                            the significant uncertainty regarding the nature of the relevant events and potential\n                            obligations, the company is not currently able to reliably estimate the amount of the\n                            obligation associated with these various lawsuits. The final outcome of the lawsuits and the\n                            cost to resolve them cannot currently be determined due to a number of variables, including\n                            uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of claimants and their allegations. Moreover,\n                            Philips Respironics has not yet completed its test and research program for all of the\n                            categories of the Recalled Devices.\n                        \n                            For the United States specifically, the relative early stage of the census registry, and\n                            lack of clarity around the nature of the specific injury each claimant is claiming,\n                            contribute to the uncertainty. In addition, the MDL court has not yet decided several\n                            significant motions, including motions to dismiss all of the complaints, and plaintiffs have\n                            not yet filed their motions for class certification in the economic loss and medical\n                            monitoring actions. Further, discovery is still in its early stages, and expert discovery\n                            has not yet begun. Moreover, Philips Respironics has not yet completed its test and research\n                            program for all of the categories of the Recalled Devices. An adverse outcome with respect\n                            to any or all of these lawsuits and/or any future claims could have a material impact on the\n                            company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n                            Securities claims\n                        \n                            On August 16, 2021, a securities class action complaint was filed against the company, its\n                            former CEO and its CFO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\n                            York alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 causing damage to investors.\n                            On January 3, 2022, the lead plaintiff in the case filed its amended complaint seeking to\n                            represent individuals that purchased Philips shares between February 23, 2016, through\n                            November 12, 2021. Following the filing and briefing of the company\u2019s motion to dismiss in\n                            the first half of 2022, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on November 30, 2022, in\n                            which the alleged damage period was expanded to include certain share price declines that\n                            were allegedly based on disclosures made in 2022. The second amended complaint now focuses\n                            on share price declines that allegedly occurred as a result of various disclosures starting\n                            on April 26, 2021 through October 2022. The company\u2019s motion to dismiss the second amended\n                            complaint is due in the first quarter of 2023.\n                        \n                            On September 11, 2022, the company received a letter from shareholders representative\n                            organization European Investors-VEB (\"VEB\"). The VEB holds Philips and its (former) managing\n                            and supervisory directors liable for \u2013 inter alia \u2013 allegedly failing to timely disclose\n                            price-sensitive information to shareholders regarding indications of potential (severe)\n                            health risks from the use of Recalled Devices, failing to exercise proper oversight over\n                            Philips Respironics and implement and ensure a proper information and risk management\n                            structure; providing incorrect or incomplete information in the company\u2019s financial\n                            disclosures.\u00a0\n                        \n                            It is the company\u2019s assessment that it is possible but not probable that these cases could\n                            lead to a certain outflow of economic resources. The company is not able to reliably estimate the financial impact, if any. An\n                            adverse outcome of these cases could have a material impact on the company\u2019s consolidated\n                            financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n                            Other claims\n                        \n                            On October 12, 2021, SoClean, a company offering ozone-based cleaning products for sleep\n                            devices, filed a lawsuit against the company and certain of its affiliates alleging that the\n                            defendants\u2019 statements about the potential adverse effect ozone cleaning may have on the\n                            recalled devices has significantly damaged its business. Philips believes that the claim is\n                            without merit and will vigorously defend itself. Motions to dismiss the case were filed in\n                            November and December 2022.\n                        \n                            In addition, some of Philips Respironics\u2019 business partners such as distributors and durable\n                            medical equipment providers have filed or threatened to file claims alleging economic losses\n                            suffered as a consequence of the voluntary recall. In particular, Philips Respironics is\n                            engaging with certain of its business partners on the level of compensation they allege to\n                            be entitled to under Philips Respironics\u2019 replacement program of the Recalled Devices.\n                        \n                            It is the company\u2019s assessment that it is possible but not probable that these cases could\n                            lead to a certain outflow of economic resources. \n                        The company is not able to reliably estimate the financial impact, if any. In\n                            the event of an adverse outcome, these matters could have a material impact on the company\u2019s\n                            consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n                            To date no provisions have been recorded for the litigation and investigations associated\n                            with the Respironics field action.\n                            Miscellaneous\n                        \n                            For details on other contractual obligations, please refer to liquidity risk in Details\n                            of treasury and other financial risks.",

Philips\n                        does not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Philips invests surplus cash in short-term deposits\n                                with appropriate maturities to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet\n                                liabilities when due and in money market funds.\n                            \n                        \n                        \n                                The rating of the company\u2019s debt by major rating agencies may improve or deteriorate. As\n                                a result, Philips\u2019 future borrowing capacity may be influenced and its financing costs\n                                may fluctuate. Philips has various sources to mitigate the liquidity risk for the group.\n                                As of December 31, 2022, Philips had EUR 1,172 million in cash and cash\n                                equivalents (2021: EUR 2,303 million), within which\n                                short-term deposits of EUR 482 million (2021: EUR 1,357 million). Cash and\n                                cash equivalents include all cash balances, money market funds and short-term highly\n                                liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily\n                                convertible into known amounts of cash. Philips pools cash from subsidiaries to the\n                                extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for the\n                                company\u2019s operational or investment needs.\n                        \n                            Philips faces cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a\n                            few countries that could limit its ability to make these balances available on short notice\n                            for general use by the group.\n                            \n                                Philips has a USD \n                            2.5 billion\n                                Commercial Paper Program and a EUR 1 billion\n                                committed standby revolving credit facility that can be used for general group purposes,\n                                such as a backstop for its Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2022, Philips\n                                did not have any loans outstanding under either facility. These facilities do not have a\n                                material adverse change clause, have no financial covenants and no credit-rating-related\n                                acceleration possibilities. Philips issued commercial paper of EUR\n                                200 million in September 2022 and EUR 101 million in October\n                                2022, that was repaid throughout the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, Philips\n                                secured a EUR 1 billion credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2022 that\n                                can be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, Philips had EUR\n                                500 million outstanding under the credit facility. The facility does not\n                                have a material adverse change clause, has no financial covenants and no\n                                credit-rating-related acceleration possibilities. As per March 9, 2020, Philips\n                                established a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program, a framework that facilitates the\n                                issuance of notes for a total amount up to EUR 10 billion. In 2022, Philips\n                                issued three new tranches under the program for a total of EUR 2 billion,\n                                while also redeeming its outstanding 2023 and 2024 Notes and issuing a tender offer on\n                                the outstanding 2025 and 2026 Notes.\u00a0For a description of Philips\u2019 credit facilities,\n                                refer to Debt.\u00a0\n                            \n                                In addition to cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2022, Philips also held EUR\n                                \n                        32 million of listed (level 1)\n                                equity investments at fair value (classified as other non-current financial assets).\n                            \n                    \n                        \n                                The following table presents a summary of the Group\u2019s fixed contractual cash obligations\n                                and commitments as of December 31, 2022. These amounts are an estimate of future\n                                payments which could change as a result of various factors such as a change in interest\n                                rates, foreign exchange, contractual provisions, as well as changes in business strategy\n                                and needs.

In such arrangements,\n                                    Philips provides the customer with a right to use of medical equipment in exchange\n                                    for a series of payments. Residual values of assets under lease form an\n                                    insignificant part of the carrying amount of those assets. Residual values are\n                                    influenced by asset market prices and are therefore subject to management\n                                    estimation. Residual values are at least reassessed on an annual basis, or more\n                                    often when necessary. Reassessments are based on a combination of realization of\n                                    assets sold, expert knowledge and judgment of local markets. For lease receivables,\n                                    the value of unguaranteed residual values as of December 31, 2022 was EUR \n                            0.6 million\n                                    (2021: EUR 0.2 million). In order to reduce residual value risk\n                                    exposures there may be residual value guarantees or purchase options embedded in the\n                                    customer contract. Credit risk for lease receivables is reviewed regularly and\n                                    mitigated, for example, by retaining a security interest in the leased asset.\n                    \n                        Currency risk\n                        \n                            Currency risk is the risk that reported financial performance or the fair value or future\n                            cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange\n                            rates.

In general, net\n                            anticipated exposures for the Group are hedged during a period of \n                        15 months in\n                            layers of 20% up to a maximum hedge\n                            of 80%. Philips\u2019 policy requires\n                            significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using\n                            forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be\n                            regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Philips from effectively and/or\n                            efficiently hedging its currency exposures.

Where\n                            the company enters into such arrangements, the financing is generally provided in the\n                            functional currency of the subsidiary entity. The currency of the company\u2019s external funding\n                            and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries, either directly\n                            through external foreign currency loans and deposits, or synthetically by using foreign\n                            exchange derivatives, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange\n                            forward contracts. In certain cases where group companies may also have external foreign\n                            currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged through the use of foreign\n                            exchange derivatives. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to this exposure are\n                            recognized within financial income and expenses in the statements of income. When such loans\n                            would be considered part of the net investment in the subsidiary, net investment hedging\n                            would be applied.\n                        \n                            Translation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is\n                            generally not hedged. If a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment\n                            hedge.

As of December 31, 2022, a weakening of USD by 10%\n                            versus the EUR would result in a decrease in the currency translation reserve in equity of\n                            approximately EUR 1,132 million, while a strengthening of USD by\n                            10% versus the EUR would result in an increase in the currency translation\n                            reserve in equity of approximately EUR 1,384 million.

As of December 31,\n                            2022, Philips had a ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total outstanding debt of\n                            approximately 80% compared to 90% one year earlier. Philips debt\n                            has a long maturity profile with an average tenor of long-term debt of 6.1\n                            years with maturities up to 2042.\n                            The following table provides the impact of a \n                        1% increase/decrease of interest\n                            rates on the fair value of the debt and the annualized net interest expenses.\n                            \n                        \n                                \n                            \n                                    Philips Group\n                                \n                            \n                                    Net debt\n                                    \n                                    and interest rate sensitivity1)\n                                        in millions of EUR\n                                \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                        \u00a0\n                                    \n                                    \n                                        2021\n                                    \n                                    \n                                        2022\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                                    \n                                \n                                        Impact \n                                    1% interest increase on the fair value of the fixed-rate\n                                        long-term debt2)\n                                    3)\n                                        \n                                    (297)\n                                        \n                                (274)\n                                    \n                                \n                                        Impact \n                                    1% interest decrease on the fair value of the fixed-rate\n                                        long-term debt2)\n                                    3)\n                                        \n                                    298\n                                        \n                                274\n                                    \n                                \n                                        Impact \n                                    1% interest increase on the annualized net interest\n                                        expense\n                                    4)\n                                        \n                                    20\n                                        \n                                4\n                        1)The definition of this non-IFRS measure and a reconciliation to the IFRS measure is included in Equity2)The sensitivity analysis conducted shows that if long-term interest rates were to increase/decrease instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31, 2022, with all other variables (including foreign exchange rates) held constant.3)Fixed-rate long-term debt is excluding forward contracts.\n                            4)The impact is based on the outstanding net cash position (after excluding fixed-rate debt) as of December 31, 2022.\n                            Global regulators and central banks have been driving international efforts to reform key\n                            benchmark interest rates (Interbank Offered Rate or IBOR rates). The market has transitioned\n                            to alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs) that are transaction-based. LIBOR has been\n                            discontinued for most currencies and maturities after December 31, 2021, except for the\n                            US-dollar for which certain maturities are expected to be phased out in 2023. The company\n                            has no interest rate hedging relationships which get affected by the reform and does not\n                            expect any significant impact on existing contracts due to change in the interest rates. The\n                            company implemented new alternative risk-free rates from January 1, 2022 and the impact upon\n                            transition was EUR 1 million financial expense.\u00a0\n                        Equity price risk\n                        \n                            Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial\n                            instrument will fluctuate because of changes in equity prices.\n                        \n                            Philips is a shareholder in some publicly listed companies and as a result is exposed to\n                            potential financial loss through movements in their share prices. The aggregate equity price\n                            exposure in such financial assets amounted to approximately EUR 32 million as of December 31, 2022\n                            (2021: EUR 67 million). Philips does\n                            not hold derivatives in the above-mentioned listed companies. Philips also has shareholdings\n                            in several privately-owned companies amounting to EUR 229 million, mainly consisting of\n                            minority stakes in companies in various industries. As a result, Philips is exposed to\n                            potential value adjustments.\n                        Commodity price risk\n                        \n                            Commodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial\n                            instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n                        \n                            Philips is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy.

As of December 31,\n                            2022 and 2021, respectively, Philips did not have any significant outstanding financial\n                            commodity derivatives.\n                        \n                    \n                            \n                    \n                                \n                        \n                            \n                                    Credit risk\n                                    \n                                        Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date,\n                                        if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as\n                                        contracted. Credit risk is present within Philips trade receivables and contract\n                                        assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Philips performs\n                                        ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its\n                                        customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate.

However, where possible the company\n                                        requires all financial institutions with which it deals in derivative\n                                        transactions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an\n                                        International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to\n                                        trading, and whenever possible, to have a strong credit rating.

                            country could adversely impact performance. The country risk per country is defined as\n                                the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country\n                                cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third\n                                parties and intercompany accounts receivable. The country risk is monitored on a regular\n                                basis.\n                            \n                                As of December 31, 2022, the company had country risk exposure of EUR \n                            14.0 billion in the United States,\n                                EUR 1.3 billion in China\n                                (including Hong Kong). Other countries higher than\u00a0EUR 500 million are Germany\u00a0EUR 808 million, United Kingdom\n                                \u00a0EUR 766 million, and JapanEUR 639 million.\n                                Other country which have significant exposure is\u00a0 Singapore EUR 206 million. The degree of risk of\n                                a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. The company does\n                                not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk.\n                                The impact of hyperinflation is also routinely assessed and was not material for the\n                                periods presented.\n                        Other insurable risks\n                    \n                        Philips is insured for a broad range of losses by global insurance policies in the areas of\n                        property damage/ business interruption, general and product liability, transport, directors\u2019 and\n                        officers\u2019 liability, employment practice liability, crime and cybersecurity. The counterparty\n                        risk related to the insurance companies participating in the above-mentioned global insurance\n                        policies is actively managed. As a rule, Philips only selects insurance companies with a\n                        financial strength of at least A-. Throughout the year the counterparty risk is monitored on a\n                        regular basis.\n                    \n                        To lower exposures and to avoid potential losses, Philips has a global Risk Engineering program\n                        in place. The main focus of this program is on property damage and business interruption risks\n                        including company interdependencies. Regular on-site assessments take place at Philips locations\n                        and business-critical suppliers by risk engineers of the insurer in order to provide an accurate\n                        assessment of the potential loss and its impact. The results of these assessments are shared\n                        across the company\u2019s stakeholders. On-site assessments are carried out against the predefined\n                        Risk Engineering standards, which are agreed between Philips and the insurers. Recommendations\n                        are made in a Risk Improvement report and are monitored centrally. This is the basis for\n                        decision-making by the local management of the business as to which recommendations will be\n                        implemented.\n                    \n                        For all policies, deductibles are in place, which vary from EUR \n                    0.3 million to EUR 10 million per occurrence and this variance\n                        is designed to differentiate between the existing risk categories within Philips. Above a first\n                        layer of working deductibles, Philips operates its own re-insurance captive, which during 2022\n                        retained EUR 25 million per claim and EUR 50 million in the annual\n                        aggregate for general, product, professional liability, and marine cargo claims.\n                        New contracts were signed effective December 31, 2022, for the coming year, whereby the\n                        re-insurance captive retentions remained the same.",
